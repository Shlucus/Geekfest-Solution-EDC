# Geekfest-Solution-EDC
This repository is the solution of <ins>team EDC</ins> for the [Bell Geekfest Hackathon 2023](https://challenges.hackworks.com/event/bell-geekfest-hackathon-2023-quebec).


- ${\color{orange}   Challenge    }$: Create an exciting software design on the theme of Online Privacy & Security.


## GenPass
- ${\color{cyan}   Solution    }$: GenPass, an innovative software designed for Online Privacy & Security, enabling users to generate complex yet memorable passwords using series of prompts and multiple  encryption methods (leetspeak, truncation, caesar cypher) to defeat password cracking tools like CUPP and wordlists like rockyou.txt while remaining easy enough for a user to mentally recall.

## Features:

- Series of prompts concatenated to generate a password,
- Complexity level: Option to choose how easy to password is to remember,
- Depending on the complexity level, goes through a series of encrypting the series of prompts,
- Description of how the password was generated.

## Instructions:

Clone the repository to your local machine and run the Project File. Due to the software being currently in its early stages, the first prompt asks to input the platform 
the password will be used for which currently only accepts Youtube or Discord. Once inputted, you are free to fill in the questions as you desire as well as choose a complexity level.

This project is open source so feel free to tune this software to your liking :)
